VetOne,"Pharmacy,Medications,Devices & Supplies","There were only 2 reviews for this item, so I read the description carefully and took a chance.  It was the right choice.  The tip of this piller is silicone and is split, so I would think most pills would fit in it.  The capsule I had to administer is the perfect fit.  The other half pill is a bit small, but still works.  It is safe for inserting - I like that the most.

She takes it very well that way.  The 2.5 are quite small. I have had times when she kept spitting it out and the coating would rub off so I'd have to start over with a new pill.

I usually split mine and put in empty gel caps then use a pill popper (pill gun) to get them down.

AlphaTRAK,"Pharmacy,Medications,Insulin & Diabetes",I probably should have read the instructions but I went on youtube and 2 videos on how they recommended using the measurements.  everything I saw was great knowledge on how to use the system and recommendations on what and how to apply to the ear when getting a blood drop for the card and reader.

AlphaTRAK,"Pharmacy,Medications,Insulin & Diabetes",This product works as intended but there are a few issues. One I find it very difficult to set the date and time on this device but I have the same issue on previous blood glucose monitors for myself. This product only requires a tiny amount of blood which is a pro but the con is getting enough blood out of my cat’s ear and it’s difficult getting the wicking part of the strip to suck up the blood proper. As a diabetic for 10 years I am a pro at taking blood and using various meters so I think practice in methodology and control of your animal is key to making this work.

Interceptor Plus,"Pharmacy,Heartworm","Got this product for my dog to use as a monthly heartworm preventive. He happily chewed it up as a treat and had no visible issues with having taken it. The very next day, he had a larger than usual poop with some huge roundworms (well, they seemed huge because he is a chihuahua/dachshund mix so he's relatively tiny). It clearly made his gut an inhospitable environment for the worms that we didn't even know he had! He has been a much more active and perky dog since then, which we think is probably related to no longer having wriggling worms in his gut.

Will continue to use as recommended for the heartworms, but the de-worming was a nice side bonus!",37.04,114,"Interceptor Plus Chewable Tablets for Dogs, 8.1-25 lbs, 6 treatments (Green Box)",38.99,4.7,Works for roundworms too!

Revolution,"Cat,Flea & Tick,Spot Treatments","Being a vet tech this was my all time favorite parasite prevention for cats. It’s one of the safest, most effective and easy to apply products. These come in the form of a liquid in small tubes. To apply you separate your cat’s fur and squirt the liquid at the base of the neck. By applying it there, it should help keep your cat from licking it. Always wash hands after administering. Everyone is different and some cats will have slight reactions. They may become itchy or be uncomfortable due to feeling like there is something on their fur. Just keep an eye on your pet. If their skin doesn’t get really red and they’re still eating and drinking normal, they should be fine, but always call your vet",115.44,386,"Revolution Topical Solution for Cats, 5.1-15 lbs (Blue Box)",121.52,4.6,Revolution

The good news is he hasn't tested positive once since I've treated him with this. It is the highly recommended by my breeder too.

So I started using this product and it's worked great.

Spinosad had low toxicity to mammals. So I chose Sentinel. It seems to work by destroying the chitin in biting female fleas.

She flinches when I give her the shot now.  I love Chewy, and this is absolutely nothing against them, but my cat and I are not happy about these gigantic needles.

My thinking was that a shorter syringe would be easier to handle, which is important for me because my dog is very squirmy when I try to administer his shots.

Bravecto,"Dog,Flea & Tick,Oral Treatments","I live in the south, which I’ve been told by a veterinarian has a worse flea problem than other areas of the U.S., and I’ve been very happy with the results from using the Bravecto chews. Pros: Fumigating the house for fleas every summer is not always a requirement; One dose lasts 12 weeks* (*Lone Star tick = 8 wks.), which means I’m less likely to forget/fall behind on their monthly treatment date; the formula of the chew is more appetizing than others to most of my dogs, making it easier to administer.

We didn’t want a topical ointment  that we had to apply and were interested in a tick collar but our pup is still being crate trained and we remove his collars daily, which would then lessen the effectiveness of the collar (although they are supposedly break away collars, I still don’t trust it) Mookie is 7 months old and has been on nexgard for several months now, we walk him in",54.14,376,"NexGard Chewable Tablets for Dogs, 24.1-60 lbs (Purple Box)",56.99,4.7,"We are impressed,"

She was an older dog but nonetheless had been in good health, she was not on any medications nor had any health issues that we were aware of. My middle aged pit survived it but she still test positive for it when we get her annual blood work done.

NexGard,"Dog,Flea & Tick,Oral Treatments","My dog had demodectic mange when we first adopted her, so the vet suggested two rounds of NexGard to help get that under control. The hair loss and itching stopped and the demodex was under control. When we went back into the vet to decide what flea and tick preventative to continue on, she advised that the topical options are pretty toxic to cats, so we stuck with NexGard as we are a mixed-species household. My dog doesn't love the chews (and she's the type of dog that will eat nearly anything - lettuce, kiwi, things you'd expect dogs to turn their noses up at), I have to cut them up pretty tiny and wrap them in cheese or something more palatable, but they have kept her 100% tick and flea free",54.14,376,"NexGard Chewable Tablets for Dogs, 24.1-60 lbs (Purple Box)",56.99,4.7,Does the Job!

NexGard,"Dog,Flea & Tick,Oral Treatments",This is what I’m currently using but I find it pricey for just 3 tablets. Plus it only kills fleas so you still need to buy a heartworm prevention with this. So those 2 added together cost a lot more than other alternatives on the market. I know they have all-in-one oral chews on the market but some of those I do not trust as far as chemical wise. Doesn’t seem to last a whole month after giving it. They start itching and biting only 2 weeks in and I have treated the whole house plus the yard. Both of my dogs take it really easily. They think it’s a treat and like the taste.

He really likes the Bravecto.  

One thing to note if you do a monthly heartworm, is that I'd recommend writing on both boxes the months they cover and when you reorder and even put the reminders in your phone.  When I'm buying I buy 2 doses of the Bravecto, which covers a total of 6 months, which complements the 6 dose box of the Interceptor Plus I buy.

This product lives up to its hype; I have never found a flea on my dog since the day he started taking bravecto... I have found countless dead ticks though. They die after they latch into the dogs, so you still have to go through and pull them off at the end of the day.

Bravecto,"Dog,Flea & Tick,Oral Treatments",Ive been using bravecto for over 3 years now and I LOVE it. This is the ONLY product on the market that is effective and lasts for 3 months! Most owners are unaware but the reason the product last for 3 months is because that’s how long the flea life cycle is (so your pet might still be itchy but defiantly a lot less). You MUST use this product past 3 months to ensure the fleas are completely gone and then itching will significantly decrease as the flea disappear from the environment & your pet. I’ve seen reviews that it “causes” seizures which is not correct. This product (like all other available flea preventions) may possibly trigger seizures if your pet already has a PRE-EXISTING epileptic,54.48,291,"Bravecto Chews for Dogs, 44-88 lbs, 1 treatment (Blue Box)",54.48,4.6,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT

Simparica,"Dog,Flea & Tick,Oral Treatments","I was using Confortis, which was OK. It helped with the flea allergy and stopped the redness, irritation and hair loss.

When my vet stopped carrying it, she recommended simparica and I was very pleased with how fast it started working. I was finding dead fleas in her fur less than a week after I gave it to her. Also I had no problem with her taking it. She ate it like it was a treat.
